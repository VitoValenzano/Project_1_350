## Project Description
For this project, we took data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS)](https://www.fda.gov/food/compliance-enforcement-food/cfsan-adverse-event-reporting-system-caers), and used it to create an ERD and a PostgreSQL database. We focused specically on Jif Extra Cruncy Peanut Butter for our project.
